TRACKING FILE IN GIT HUB COMMANDS
            git add index.html     [track define files] [this untrack file color is red]
            git add .              [track all file]

HOW TO CHANGE DIRECTORY
use command in terminal 
cd ../folder name here

HOW TO CREATE REPOSITORY LOCALLY IN VS CODE FOLLOW THIS STEPS:

first make folder
in terminal use git init - it will initialize the emty repository
now create any a file
track that file
commit that file
at the time of push we need to configure where to push that file on remote
this is the location where we need to push
                    git remote add origin https://github.com/jaydevsonip/soni_temp_1.git
now we have location 
now we are ready to push the file
		git push -u origin master
this command helps to push on repository that we created in vs code loccal
HOW TO CHECK HOW MANY BRANCH IS THERE IN OUR PROJECT
		git branch

HOW TO CREATE A BRANCH WITH USING VS CODE TERMINAL
		git checkout -b feature     [feature is branch name]
		checkout is also use for switching branch

HOW TO DELETE BRANCH 
		git branch -d  brachname.here

SENARIO-
WE CREATED A BRANCH FROM MASTER BRANCH
OUR BRANCH NAME IS branchOne
now we can do modification in this branch 
at the time of merge on git hub we are not direct merge on it github
first we go in that created branch and make untrack file to track file
-now we are commit our file on that brach
-after we will push on that branch 
it wil shows some pushimg  upstrim origin error write it on the terminal
example     git push --set-upstream origin branchOne
since upstrim mentiond before just write on terminal

			git push -u origin branchOne

now the req goes to web git hub for mearge  , accept it and do comments if req and merge

SHORTHAND COMMAND FOR COMMIT AND ADD
 			git commit -am "messagehere"
